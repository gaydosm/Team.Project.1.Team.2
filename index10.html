    <b><i style="font-family:Courier; font-size:100%; text-align:center; display:block;"> Andres F. Customer from Fisher's, IN:</i></b>
    <b style="font-size:90%; text-align:center; display:block;"> My wife and I got married last summer. When considering a reliable food catering business, Fiesta Empire immediately came to mind. Not only did the staff communicate effectively with our venue, but they also handled everything. We had great food on our wedding day, and we thank them for their fantastic service. </b>
