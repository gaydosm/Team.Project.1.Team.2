      Andres F. Customer from Fisher's, IN:</i></b>
     <b style="font-size:90%; text-align:center; display:block;text-My wife and I got married last summer. When considering a reliable food catering business, Fiesta Empire immediately came to mind. Not only did the staff communicate effectively with our venue, but they also handled everything. We had great food on our wedding day, and we thank them for their fantastic service.</b>

      Sarah P. Customer from West Lafayette, IN:</i></b>
     <b style="font-size:90%; text-align:center; display:block;text-My son is a recent Purdue Business Graduate (Boiler Up!). Our family had an amazing experience with Fiesta Empire. They had many options for his big party, and brought much more food than expected. My son loved it, and he received numerous compliments from the party attendees. I will be keeping Fiesta Empire in mind for my next catering need.
